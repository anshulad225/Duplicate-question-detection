# ❓ Duplicate Question Detection

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to determine whether two questions are semantically similar. It's designed to reduce redundancy in Q&A platforms and improve search accuracy.

## 📌 Features

- Text preprocessing and feature extraction  
- Semantic similarity detection using ML/DL models  
- Evaluation with real-world question pairs (e.g., Quora dataset)  
- Web interface or script-based predictions (optional)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- scikit-learn / XGBoost / TensorFlow  
- NLTK / SpaCy / Hugging Face Transformers  
- Jupyter Notebook / Streamlit (optional for UI)


## 📊 Dataset

- Uses the [Quora Question Pairs dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/quora-question-pairs)

## 📈 Model Performance

- Accuracy / F1 Score / AUC based on validation set  
- Includes baseline and advanced models for comparison
## Credits
